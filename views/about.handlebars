                        <p>
                            The goal, in any school system, is to provide an environment where students are encouraged to strive academically and reach their full potential. This group ties hand-in- hand with building self-
                            confidence, ensuring student safety, creating community acceptance, and enhancing academic growth across all programs of study. According to a study at the University of Calgary, Gay-
                            Straight Alliances are “one of the fastest growing social movements within schools in North America.” With a focus on positivity and acceptance, the St. Clair College Gay-Straight Alliance
                            will allow this school to remain relevant in its efforts to maintain a student focus.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Statistics show that youth who are harassed on the basis of sexual orientation are more than twice as likely to report depression and seriously consider suicide. They are also more likely to
                            receive low grades, smoke, drink alcohol, use drugs, and become victims of violence. Approximately 9 out of 10 students have reported hearing negative comments based on sexual
                            orientation within school hallways, and 2 out of every 3 students (who identify as LGBTQ) have reported being harassed based on actual, or perceived, sexual orientation. Nearly 60% of
                            heterosexual youth find homophobic comments to also be upsetting and a Gay-Straight Alliance at St. Clair College would promote solidarity amongst all students.

                    The St. Clair College Gay-Straight Alliance is a club which was sanctioned under SRC for the first time in September, 2014. The GSA is proud to be the first non-program based club to exist as a
                    ratified SRC club in the history of St. Clair College and caused a revision to be made in the legislation for club ratification. This now allows all interest-based clubs to be recognized under SRC
                    (pending appropriate documentation required by all clubs) and receive all advantages of a program-based club except for the funding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since the initial ratification, the GSA has been an extremely active club, hosting monthly events and attending even more events in the community to lend our support and resources. Meetings fluctuate
                    days and times to accommodate a variety of class schedules, but occur nearly every week.
